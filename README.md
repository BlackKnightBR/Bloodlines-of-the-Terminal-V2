ðŸ©¸ Bloodlines of the Terminal â€” V2: Cursed Depths
A terminal-born dark fantasy RPG, reborn in deeper shadows.
In Cursed Depths, the dungeon awakens.

The darkness is no longer confined to battle. Now it breathes in exploration, decision-making, and character evolution. You will walk deeper into cursed corridors, face unspeakable horrors, loot ancient relics, and shape your path through branching choices.

This version transcends the arenaâ€”bringing rooms with consequences, items with synergy, and monsters with memory.
