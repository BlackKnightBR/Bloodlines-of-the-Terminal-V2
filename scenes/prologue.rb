      You awaken in shadows, your mind fogged with fractured memories 
      of a brutal capture by a savage band of Goblins.
      
      The darkness of the cramped cell wraps around you, but the door stands ajarâ€”
      creaking like a sinister invitation into the unknown...

      You rise... something inside you hungers for revenge.
